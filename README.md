## About
In this project, we attempted to apply the Bechdel tests to movies and see which movies do or do not pass this test. Furthermore, this project allowed us to apply our knowledge of data structures taught to us throughout this semester in 230 to sort through movies and actors using graphs.

## Context
In 1983, American cartoonist Alison Bechdel released her comic strip “Dykes to Watch Out For”, which chronicled the lives, loves, and politics of a diverse group of characters (most being lesbians) living in a city in the United States. In “The Rule '', a DTWOF strip released in 1985, two female characters heading to a movie theater discuss their criteria for which they decide whether or not they would watch that movie. They detail that the movie must satisfy the following requirements:
- The movie has at least two women characters,
- who talk to each other,
- about something other than a man.

Thus, the concept of the Bechdel (or Bechdel-Wallace) Test, which provides a criteria/measure of the representation of women in film and other fiction, was introduced into the mainstream.

To this day, the representation (or lack thereof) for women in both character, acting, and production roles has been a very important discussion. While progress has been made towards greater representation of women in media and movies, there is still a long way to go. It is important for the industry to continue to prioritize diversity and inclusivity, both in front of and behind the camera, in order to create more accurate and inclusive portrayals of women on screen.
